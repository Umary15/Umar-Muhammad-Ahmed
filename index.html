        <h2>My Journey so far:</h2>

        <p>
            I have already built a strong foundation in web development basics. HTML, Git, and GitHub, especially since my enrollment in IT program. 
            I have learned how to create and publish simple websites, handle Git repository issues, and understand how version control really works.
            <br>

                </p>
            <br>
            I have also explored the difference between landing pages, personal blogs, and portfolio sites, skills that shaped my first online identity. 
            This journey has equipped me with practical skills and knowledge,
            giving me a mix of technical and problem-solving ability that I am excited to build upon as I continue my learning path. 
            Viewing and analyzing other developers' code on GitHub has been incredibly helpful, allowing me to see different approaches and best practices in action. 
            This exposure is enhancing my coding skills and inspiring me to experiment with new techniques in my own projects.
        </p>

        <h3> What i am learning right now: </h3> 
        
        <p>
           I am deepening my understanding of front-end development, learning how to design pages that not only function but look and feel good on all devices. 
            I have a great passion about personal branding and web content and can't wait to showcase that I am learning how to present my skills publicly, 
            not just privately.

            <br>

                </p>
            <br>

            I am also exploring responsive design principles to ensure my websites work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
            Additionally, I am starting to learn the basics of JavaScript to add interactivity to my web pages.
            This combination of design and functionality is helping me create more engaging user experiences.

        <h3>  What I will likely dive into next:</h3>

                </p>
            <br>

           
            The next natural steps would in sha Allah be:
            <ul>
                <li> 
                     CSS & JavaScript mastery: to bring real interactivity and polish to my web projects.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Full-stack or data integration: connecting websites with databases or APIs to make them dynamic.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Data visualization tools (like Power BI, Tableau, or Python‚Äôs libraries) ‚Äî this will combine my analytics side with my design eye.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Personal brand building: I am already thinking about my online presence ‚Äî I believe polishing my portfolio and writing short content pieces could make me a recognized voice among student developers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Community involvement: contributing to open-source projects or joining tech communities also can boost my learning and network.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Soft skills: communication, project management, and teamwork are crucial as I start collaborating on bigger projects or internships.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Exploring emerging tech: once I am comfortable with the basics, dabbling in AI, blockchain, or cybersecurity could open new doors for me.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Internships or freelance work: real-world experience will solidify my skills and build my resume.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Continuous learning: tech evolves fast, so staying curious and adaptable will keep me ahead.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Teaching or mentoring: sharing my knowledge through blogs, tutorials, or mentoring can reinforce my learning and establish me as a community contributor.
                </li>
            </ul>
           
           
            
            In short, I am moving from learning how to build things, to creating my own digital identity, to teaching or inspiring others soon.
