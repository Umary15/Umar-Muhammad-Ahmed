            My name is <b>Umar Muhammad Ahmad.</b> I am a student at Gombe State University, currently undergoing my SIWES IT program at Pantami Digital Age Technologies.
            I am an enthusiast and optimist in technology, with keen interests in software engineering, blockchain, and cyber security. Going forward, 
            I will be sharing my journey, including the challenges and struggles I encounter along the way.
        </p>

        <h2>Week 1: Introduction to the Web</h2>
        <p>
            Just like every other journey we started with understanding the fundamentals of what the web is.
            The web, or World Wide Web, is a system of interlinked documents and resources accessed via the internet.
            I learned that the internet is a global network connecting millions of computers, enabling them to communicate and share useful information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites.
            It involves both the visible part of a website (front-end) and the behind-the-scenes logic and databases (back-end).
            I also explored how networks allow devices to connect and exchange data, making the internet possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Websites work by using web servers to store content and web browsers to display it.
            When you enter a website address, your browser requests information from a server. 

            The server then sends the requested data back to your browser, which renders the web page for you to view and interact with.

    <h2>Week 2: Gitting ðŸš€</h2>
        <p>
            The second week is when the real stuggle started, I was taught the basics of GitHub.
            I learned how to create repositories, commit changes, and
            collaborate on projects using version control.
            This introduction to GitHub provided a strong foundation
            for managing and sharing my code as I continue my journey in
            web development.
        </p>

             <p><img src="images/img 5.jpg" width="700" height="250" ></p> 

        <p>When i started, it actually felt like some rocket science but with
            consistent practice and learning, I was solwly able to grasp the concepts.
            I am very exticed now that i hadn't gave up at the intial stage. and here i am now 
            sharing my journey with you all.        
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, I want you to know that I was not alone; I had help from tutors and friends. Below are some online tutorials I found helpful for getting started with Git and GitHub:</p>
        <ul>
             <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/">Learn the Basics of Git in Under 10 Minutes (freeCodeCamp)</a></li>
             <li><a href="https://youtu.be/RGOj5yH7evk?si=Ytr6IZyjz-RgNAws">Git and GitHub for Beginners Crash Course (YouTube)</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It took more than a week to get familiar with git and GitHub, and that's how 3 weeks passed.
            Looking back, the journey through these first weeks was both challenging and rewarding. 
            Every struggle and every small victory helped me grow more confident in my abilities. 
            If you are just starting out, remember that persistence and curiosity are your best tools. 
            The world of technology is vast, but with each step, it becomes more familiar and exciting.
        </p>

        
    <h2>Getting Started with HTML</h2>
    <p>
        At this point, I honestly lost count of the weeks, but my journey continued as I delved into HTML. 
        Learning HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was my first real step into building actual web pages. 
        It was exciting to see how simple tags could structure content and bring a blank page to life.
    </p>
    <p>
        I discovered how to use headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists to organize information on 
        a web page. Understanding the basics of HTML gave me the confidence to experiment and create my own 
        simple websites. Each new tag I learned felt like unlocking a new superpower in web development.
    </p>
    <p>
        This phase taught me that web development is a continuous learning process, and it's okay to lose 
        track of time as long as you keep moving forward. The more I practiced, the more comfortable I became 
        with building and structuring web content from scratch.

        Sometimes the journey feels overwhelming, but every challenge is a step forward.
